Flask application with a RESTful API for managing books and customers. 
The application allows users to add, delete, and borrow books, as well as add and delete customers.

HTML template contains the structure and forms for managing books, customers, and book borrowing and returning. Here's a summary of the key elements in your HTML template:

Meta Tags and Title: These tags define the character set and viewport settings for your web page, as well as the title.

External CSS: You link to an external CSS file (styles.css) to style your web page.

Font Awesome Icons: You include Font Awesome icons to enhance the visual elements of your web page.

JavaScript Functions: You define several JavaScript functions for client-side validation and actions, including editing and deleting books and customers.

Navigation Menu: You have a navigation menu with links for adding books, adding customers, borrowing books, and returning books.

Forms:

Add a New Book Form: Allows users to add a new book with fields for title, author, year published, and copies available.

Edit Book Form: Appears when editing a book. It allows users to modify book details.

Display Book Records: Shows a table displaying book records with options to edit or delete each book.

Add a New Customer Form: Allows users to add a new customer with fields for ID and name.

Edit Customer Form: Appears when editing a customer. It allows users to modify customer details.

Display Customer Records: Shows a table displaying customer records with options to edit or delete each customer.

Borrow a Book Form: Allows customers to borrow a book by entering their ID and the book's ID.

Return a Book Form: Allows customers to return a book by entering their ID and the book's ID.

External JavaScript Libraries: You include jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap JS from content delivery networks (CDNs) to enhance your web page's functionality.

Custom JavaScript File: You include a custom JavaScript file (script.js) to add your own custom functionality.

Initialization: You initialize the Flask app, set up a Flask-RESTful API, and define a secret key for flash messages.

Data Structures: You create two empty lists, books and customers, to store information about books and customers.

Book and Customer Classes: You define two classes, Book and Customer, to represent book and customer objects. The Book class stores information about books, and the Customer class stores information about customers, including the books they've borrowed.

Request Parsers: You define request parsers using reqparse from Flask-RESTful to validate and parse incoming POST requests for adding books and customers.

Resource Classes: You define resource classes for the RESTful API. BookResource handles book-related operations, such as getting a list of books, adding a new book, and deleting a book. CustomerResource handles customer-related operations in a similar way.

API Endpoints: You add the resource classes to the API and define the API endpoints for accessing books and customers.

Home Page (index): You define a route for the home page (/) that renders an HTML template with lists of books and customers.

Borrow and Return Books: You define routes for borrowing and returning books (/borrow_book and /return_book) that allow customers to borrow and return books. These routes interact with the Customer and Book objects and update the respective lists.

Main Execution: You start the Flask app with debugging enabled when the script is run directly (if __name__ == '__main__':).

Overall, this Flask application provides a basic interface for managing books and customers, including RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access and HTML templates for user interaction. Users can add, delete, borrow, and return books, as well as add and delete customers. Flash messages are used to provide feedback on the success or failure of these operations.


## Table of Contents

  - [Project Name](Library)
  - [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
  - [Description]

    This documentation provides a clear structure for explaining the project, its features, how to get started with it, and other important details. 

    Flask is the main class used to create a Flask application.
    render_template is used to render HTML templates.
    request is used to handle HTTP requests.
    redirect and url_for are used for URL redirection.

    Two empty lists, books and customers, are created to store information about books and customers.

    Two classes, Book and Customer, are defined to represent book and customer objects, respectively. These classes have constructors to initialize their attributes.

    / (index) route corresponds to the home page. It renders an HTML template (index.html) and passes lists of books and customers to be displayed on the page.

    /add_book route corresponds to the home page. It renders an HTML template (index.html) and passes lists of books and customers to be displayed on the page.

    /add_customer route similar to adding a book, it is used to add a new customer. 
    It retrieves customer information from a form, creates a new Customer object, and adds it to the customers list. Then, it redirects back to the home page.

    /borrow_book route handles borrowing a book. 
    It retrieves the customer ID and book title from a form, finds the customer and book by their respective attributes, and updates the lists accordingly. 
    It also checks if there are available copies of the book.

    /return_book route handles returning a book. It works similarly to the borrow_book route but in reverse. It finds the customer and book and returns the book to the library.

    if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
    This block of code checks if the script is the main application and then starts the Flask web server in debug mode if it is. 
    Debug mode provides helpful error messages and auto-reloads the server when you make changes to the code during development.

## Usage

Here are the steps to get started with the Flask Book Management Application:

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Flask
- Flask-RESTful

You can install Flask and Flask-RESTful using pip:

```bash
pip install flask flask-restful
pip install flask_cors

    1. Access the Web Interface:
    The librarian should open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the library management system is hosted. 
    By default, it's often http://localhost:5000/.

    2. View Existing Books:
    On the home page of the library management system, the librarian can see a list of existing books in the library. 
    This list displays book titles, authors, and the number of copies available.

    3. Add a New Book:
    The librarian can find a section labeled "Add a New Book." 
    This section typically includes input fields for the book's title, author, and the number of copies available.
    The librarian should fill out these fields with the relevant information for the new book they want to add.

    4. Submit the Book Details:
    After entering the book's information, the librarian should click the "Add Book" or "Submit" button, which will initiate a form submission.

    5. Confirmation and Update:
    Upon successful submission, the system should add the new book to the list of books in the library, including the title, author, and the specified number of copies.
    The librarian will usually receive a confirmation message, such as "Book added successfully."

    6. View Updated Book List:
    The librarian can now see the updated list of books, including the newly added book.

    7. Repeat as Needed:
    If the librarian needs to add more books, they can repeat the process by going back to the "Add a New Book" section and entering the details for each additional book.

    8. Log Out:
    Once the librarian has finished adding books, they can log out or simply close the web browser.
    
    
  - [Features]
    The librarian's interaction with the system is through the user-friendly web interface, 
    which simplifies the process of adding books to the library's collection. 
    The system takes care of storing the book details and updating the list of available books accordingly.
    - Add new books with title, author, and publication year.
    - Update existing book information.
    - Delete books from the library.
    - Search for books by title or author.

## Deployment

Running the Application
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/SergeyReizman/New_Library.git

Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

cd New_Library

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional):

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the following commands:

# Create a virtual environment (optional)

python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)

venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (on macOS/Linux)

source venv/bin/activate

install Flask and Required Dependencies:

Inside your virtual environment (if you created one), install Flask and any other required dependencies using pip:

pip install Flask

pip install flask-restful

pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy

pip install Flask-WTF

pip install Jinja2

In your command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Flask application (app.py) and run the application:

py app.py

The application will start, and you will see output indicating that the Flask development server is running similar to:

 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the home page.

You should see output .

Access the Application:

Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 (or the URL specified in your Flask application if you customized it). You should be able to access and interact with your library management system.

## Testing

Test the Application:

You can use your web browser to test the functionality by adding books, adding customers, borrowing books, and returning books through the web interface.

Shutdown the Application:

To stop the Flask application, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the Flask server is running.

Remember that this is a basic test environment for your Flask application. 
In a production environment, you would typically use a production web server (e.g., Gunicorn) and consider deploying your application to a hosting platform like Heroku or a cloud service like AWS or Google Cloud. Additionally, for a production system, you should use a database to store data persistently rather than relying on in-memory data structures as demonstrated in your code.


Adding Books and Customers
To add a book, click on the "Add a Book" button on the home page. Fill in the required information (Title, Author, Copies) and submit the form.

To add a customer, click on the "Add a Customer" button on the home page. Provide the Customer ID and Name and submit the form.

Borrowing and Returning Books
To borrow a book, select a customer from the dropdown list, and enter the title of the book you want to borrow. Click on the "Borrow" button.

To return a book, select the customer who borrowed the book and enter the title of the book you want to return. Click on the "Return" button.

API Endpoints
You can also interact with the application's API endpoints:

Book API: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/books
Customer API: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/customers
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors, make sure to check the following:

Ensure that the prerequisites are installed correctly.
Check for any syntax errors or typos in your code.
Review the console output for any error messages.
